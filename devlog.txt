Added functioning dictionary code to retrieve words to draw

gaoJ -- 2018-01-06 21:10
Added routes to app.py and html files to allow users to choose topic and word to draw.  Also modified base.html to accomodate painting.html (which now extends "base.html").

zlotskiyM -- 2018-01-06 21:17
Fixed all the bugs in users.py (database interface). Specifically - users can have null stats, and missing images are replaced by default ones.
