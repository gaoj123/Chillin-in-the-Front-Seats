soeW -- 2018-01-08 01:41

gaoJ, liK, zlotskiyM, soeW -- 2018-01-16 14:40
Came up with new plan for how our game works since Clarifai app could not guess images accurately.  Thought over how to implement plan using databases.

liK -- 2018-01-17 16:38
Fixed navbar and improved formatting for login and create account forms.

Wrote methods to access notifications from the database.

gaoJ -- 2018-01-20 22:33
Worked on guess and score routes in app.py by calling database methods in users.py, also worked on their corresponding html files.  Fixed login redirect issue.  Also started notifications route/HTML

zlotskiyM, soeW -- 2018-01-21 12:13
Fixed some issues with the database. Points are now correctly awarded, and the best/worst images are kept track of. Wrote a very long SQL statement.

gaoJ -- 2018-01-21 20:14
Worked on guess and notifications routes and did Jinja/HTML.  These are currently working.  Users can draw and guess other users' drawings.  Guessing it correctly results in +5 to guesser score.  Also worked on view route, which allows individual drawings to be viewed; clicking it brings to a page with info like score if it has been guessed correctly and incorrect guesses for that drawing.  Noted problems including best/worst image.

gaoJ -- 2018-01-22 10:55
Fixed profile's best/worst image score to address all cases of "N/A".  Also modified what's displayed on the page when a user clicks on a notification to show the same message.  In addition, time is now included in notifications.
