Drawnet is a website where users can play a game similar to Pictionary.  Users have two options: guess other users’ drawings or create their own drawings.  To draw, users first choose what they want to draw from a list of nouns.  They are then led to a canvas - program like Paint - where they draw the object they chose and submit that drawing to be guessed by others.  Drawers will receive notifications regarding other people’s guesses of their drawings.  For the drawer, the drawing is scored as follows: 20 - n (where “n” is the number of guessers who guessed the user’s drawing incorrectly); after all, the quicker the drawing is guessed correctly, the better the quality of the user’s drawing. If the guesser guesses a drawing correctly, the guesser gets 5 points. Thus, each user has two overall scores, as a guesser and as a drawer.   <br><br>
